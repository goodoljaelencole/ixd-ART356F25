# Chapter 2 Discussion: *The Psychology of Everyday Actions*
**From**: *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman  
---

## Overview
Chapter 2 explores how people **do things**, why they sometimes **fail to do what they intend**, and how **design either bridges or widens** the gap between *human thought* and *system behavior*.  
Key ideas include:  
- The **Seven Stages of Action**  
- The **Gulf of Execution** and the **Gulf of Evaluation**  
- How **emotion** and **subconscious thought** affect our interactions with design  

Norman’s message: *Good design makes the right actions easy to discover and the results easy to interpret.*

## 🧊 Icebreaker: "Design Fails in Real Life" (5–7 min)
**Prompt:**  
> Think about a time you used an everyday object — like a microwave, printer, or door — and it didn’t behave how you expected. What went wrong?

**Goal:**  
Warm up the group and connect everyone through relatable experiences of design confusion.

**Facilitator Notes:**  
- Encourage short, funny, or frustrating stories.  
- Write a few examples on the board (e.g., hotel showers, elevator buttons, car dashboards).  
- Transition: “These moments show the *gulf between what we intend and what actually happens* — exactly what Norman explores in this chapter.”

## 💬 Discussion Question 1: The Missing Stage (10–12 min)
> “Norman describes the *Seven Stages of Action* — from forming a goal to evaluating the outcome. Which stage do designers overlook most often, and why?”

**Follow-up prompts:**  
- How does feedback influence whether users feel successful or frustrated?  
- Can you think of a product that gives clear feedback at every step?  
- What happens emotionally when feedback is missing?

**Example “breadcrumb” from facilitator:**  
> “When I press a button on an elevator and it doesn’t light up, I feel uncertain — has the action even registered? That’s a breakdown in feedback.”

## 🧩 Breakout Activity: Map the Seven Stages 
**Instructions:**  
1. Split into small groups.  
2. Choose a simple everyday task (e.g., making coffee, sending a text, using a crosswalk).  
3. Map your process using Norman’s **Seven Stages of Action**:
   1. Forming the goal  
   2. Forming the intention  
   3. Specifying the action  
   4. Executing the action  
   5. Perceiving the state of the world  
   6. Interpreting the perception  
   7. Evaluating the outcome  
4. Identify **one breakdown** in the process and propose a **design fix** that would make the action smoother.

**Share:**  
Each group presents one “pain point” and one redesign idea.

**Example:**  
> Task: Using a hotel shower  
> Problem: No clear feedback on temperature direction → redesign the handle with clear color-coded signifiers.

## 🗣️ Discussion Question 2: The Two Gulfs (10–12 min)
> “Norman talks about the ‘Gulf of Execution’ (difficulty doing what you intend) and the ‘Gulf of Evaluation’ (difficulty understanding what happened). Which gulf is more dangerous in modern tech design?”

**Follow-ups:**  
- How do these gulfs appear in smartphone interfaces, apps, or AI systems?  
- Can aesthetics and usability coexist, or does one usually win out?  
- What can designers do to close these gulfs?

**Facilitator Reflection:**  
> “If users blame themselves for design failures, what responsibility do designers have to prevent that?”

---

## 🔄 Closing Reflection (5 min)
**Prompt:**  
> “After reading Chapter 2, what’s one change you’ll make in how you evaluate design in your daily life?”

**Optional Wrap-Up Activity:**  
Have everyone finish this sentence:  
> “Good design should make it easy to _______.”

**Closing Thought:**  
Design isn’t just about function — it’s about *helping people bridge the gap between what they want to do and what actually happens.*
