In Chapter 4 of *The Design of Everyday Things* (pp. 125–141), Don Norman explores how effective design enables users to “know what to do” through the interplay of constraints, discoverability, and feedback. He identifies four types of constraints—physical, semantic, cultural, and logical—as the mental scaffolding that helps users navigate unfamiliar systems without instruction. Physical constraints rely on the properties of the world to prevent error; semantic constraints draw on meaning and context; cultural constraints stem from learned conventions; and logical constraints guide reasoning through process of elimination. Together, they narrow the field of possible actions, ensuring that correct behavior feels natural and intuitive. Norman connects these principles to affordances and signifiers, arguing that good design communicates function through form—when a door requires a “PUSH” label, it has already failed. He extends this logic to forcing functions, mechanisms that prevent mistakes by structuring action sequences, such as a car that cannot start unless in park. Throughout, Norman insists that usability is not an afterthought but a moral responsibility: confusion reflects design failure, not user error. By integrating constraints into the visible and behavioral language of products, designers create experiences that guide, protect, and empower without words—a seamless conversation between human intuition and human-made systems.
