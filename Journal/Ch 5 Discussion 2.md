### Chapter 5, Part 2: Human Error? No—Bad Design

This section of Chapter 5 pushed me to rethink the idea of “human error.” Norman makes it clear that most mistakes aren’t actually human failings—they’re design failures. People don’t wake up wanting to press the wrong button, misread a panel, or forget a step. They make those errors because the system quietly nudges them in the wrong direction.

The discussion on **reporting error** stood out to me. Norman shows how organizations often respond to mistakes by punishing individuals instead of asking why the system made the mistake possible in the first place. When blame becomes the focus, learning stops. Nothing improves.

His points about **error detection** and **designing for error** felt especially important. Systems should assume users will forget something, get distracted, or slip. Good design makes those mistakes easy to catch or harmless. Features like forcing functions, confirmation prompts, and clear feedback aren’t “nice extras”—they’re safeguards that acknowledge human reality.

What resonated most is how Norman frames the issue. He isn’t criticizing people—he’s defending them. He shifts the spotlight onto the design, not the user. That perspective feels rare. We still blame individuals for mistakes that were engineered into the system long before they touched it.

These pages reminded me that **good design accepts that people are imperfect**. It builds in room for recovery. It anticipates confusion and redirects instead of punishing. In a world where user error is still treated like a moral failing, Norman’s perspective feels refreshing and necessary.
